# The Flux architectural pattern using `useReducer` and `the Context` API

Just in case, here a nice diagram about the generic Flux pattern.

## So, what does this repo even exist?

It demonstrates the combination of :

- `Context` API and hook
- `useReducer` hook
- Sagas

## But why, you ask ?

Because I can ;)

No, but seriously, because I needed to make sense of Redux, of the Context API, and more generally, the Flux Pattern, and of async actions.

Also, to me, it is important to eval every package I include in my apps, and `useContext` and `useReducer` being shipped defacto with React is a plus.

So this demo allows to demonstrate that the `redux` and `react-redux` packages are no longer required dependencies to implement the Flux Pattern in React, in a way that makes both sense and is scalable with combined reducers to handle endless future slices of state.

## Word of caution

What this demo does not demonstrate though, is if this combination mimicking redux will be as performant as redux.
And this, I do not know myself, as this is very experimental. I wouldn't recommend using this in production ;).

## Notes

This demos depends on a tiny package called `use-react-saga`.

All it is, is a custom hook for react which depends on the `redux-saga` package, which is something I wanted to experiment with, for async actions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
